I am a researcher with the Square Kilometre Array South Africa project, based in Cape Town. I work on developing interferometric imaging and calibration algorithms, designing FPGA firmware for radio telescopes, and surfing. I am currently teaching the NASSP 2016 masters' course on [Radio Interferometry](https://griffinfoster.github.io/fundamentals_of_interferometry/).

Until I find different, the Knead in Muizenberg makes the best croissant in Cape Town.
