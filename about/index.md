I am a post-doctoral researcher in the astrophysics department at the University of Oxford, and a visiting scholar at the Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC) at the University of California at Berkeley. My research is focused on the detection of rare and anomalous signals, primarily fast radio bursts (FRBs) and radio transmissions from intelligent, extra-terrestrial sources. I was previously with the Square Kilometre Array South Africa project, based in Cape Town.
