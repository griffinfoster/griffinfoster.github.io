#I am a researcher with the Square Kilometre Array South Africa project, based in Cape Town. I develop interferometric imaging and calibration algorithms, design FPGA firmware for radio telescopes, and surf. I taught the NASSP 2016 masters' course on [Radio Interferometry](https://griffinfoster.github.io/fundamentals_of_interferometry/), currently I am working on writing an open course textbook.

#The best croissant I have had in Cape Town is from Ta-Da! in Muizenberg.

I am a post-doctoral researcher in the astrophysics department at the University of Oxford, and a visiting scholar at the Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC) at the University of California at Berkeley. My research is focused on the detection of rare and anomalous signals, primarily fast radio bursts (FRBs) and radio transmissions from intelligent, extra-terrestrial sources. I was previously with the Square Kilometre Array South Africa project, based in Cape Town.
