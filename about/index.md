I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [astrophysics sub-department](http://pulsars.web.ox.ac.uk/people/griffin-foster) at the University of Oxford, and a visiting scholar at the [Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC)](https://seti.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California at Berkeley. My research is focused on the detection of rare and anomalous signals with applied machine learning and signal processing techniques, primarily fast radio bursts (FRBs) and techno-signatures from intelligent, extra-terrestrial sources. I was previously with the Square Kilometre Array South Africa project, based in Cape Town where I designed FPGA-based instrumentation, and worked on imaging and calibration problems in interferometry.

Currently, I am the project scientist for Breakthrough Listen on MeerKAT. In addition, I am building digital back-ends at Arecibo Observatory, the Green Bank Telescope, and international LOFAR stations to perform commensal SETI and FRB surveys.
