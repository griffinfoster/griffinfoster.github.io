I am a reseach engineer at [Zendar](http://www.zendar.io) where I work on SAR for automotive use. Previously, I was a radio astronomer. My research was focused on the detection of rare and anomalous signals with applied machine learning and signal processing techniques, primarily fast radio bursts (FRBs) and techno-signatures from intelligent, extra-terrestrial sources.
