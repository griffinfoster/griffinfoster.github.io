I am a researcher with the Square Kilometre Array South Africa project, based in Cape Town. I develop interferometric imaging and calibration algorithms, design FPGA firmware for radio telescopes, and surf. I taught the NASSP 2016 masters' course on [Radio Interferometry](https://griffinfoster.github.io/fundamentals_of_interferometry/), currently I am working on writing an open course textbook.

The best croissant I have had in Cape Town is from Ta-Da! in Muizenberg.
