I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [astrophysics department](http://pulsars.web.ox.ac.uk/people/griffin-foster) at the University of Oxford, and a visiting scholar at the [Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC)](https://seti.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California at Berkeley. My research is focused on the detection of rare and anomalous signals with applied machine learning techniques and signal processing techniques, primarily fast radio bursts (FRBs) and radio transmissions from intelligent, extra-terrestrial sources. I was previously with the Square Kilometre Array South Africa project, based in Cape Town where I designed FPGA-based instrumentation, and worked on imaging and calibration problems in interferometry.

Currently, I am working on [ALFABURST](http://naic.edu/~alfafrb/), the commensal FRB search instrument at Arecibo Observatory.
