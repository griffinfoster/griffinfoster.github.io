A python package for generating radio interferometry images from LOFAR station ACC and XST files, and from widefield, low-frequency measurement sets (e.g. PAPER) using a Spherical Wave Harmonic Transform ([Imaging on a Sphere with Interferometers: the Spherical Wave Harmonic Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04485)) and a standard 2D Fourier Transform.

* [Current Release (pypi)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SWHT)
