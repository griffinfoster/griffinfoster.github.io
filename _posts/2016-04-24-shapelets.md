A python package for fitting and decomposing images (FITS, PNG, JPEG...) into shapelet coefficients, and modelling visibilities. Support for Cartesian and polar forms using Hermite and Laguerre polynomials. 

Based on the shapelet framework developed in [Shapelets: I. A Method for Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105178) and the [IDL shapelet software](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~rjm/shapelets/).

* [Current Release (pypi)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/shapelets)
* [Development (github)](https://github.com/griffinfoster/shapelets)
